# Setup for XPP PRI. This allows to have fixed settings:
#   1. The variable XPP_PRI_SETUP contains a whitespace separated list of
#      port specifications.
#   2. Each port specification contains a match expression, a '=' and
#      a setting string.
#   2. Match expressions may be:
#      - CONNECTOR/usb..../XPD-nn	To identify by physical connector
#      - NUM/XBUS-mm/XPD-nn		To identify by bus number
#   4. Match expressions may contain "wildcards" (which are translated
#      internally to regular expressions):
#        * matches zero or more characters.
#        ? matches one charater
#   5. The list of matches is scanned from beginning to end. First match wins.
#   6. The list implicitly contains an 'NUM/*=TE,E1' catch all default, appended
#      to its end.
#   7. The setting string is composed of comma separated settings. Valid
#      settings are:
#      - NT or TE
#      - E1 or T1 or J1
