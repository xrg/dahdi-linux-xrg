.SH NAME
fpga_load \- Xorcom Astribank (xpp) firmware tool
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B fpga_load 
[\fB-g\fR] [\fB-r\fR] [\fB-v\fR] \fB-D \fR{/proc/bus/usb|/dev/bus/usb}/\fIBUS/DEV\fR 

.B fpga_load 
[\fB-g\fR] [\fB-v\fR] \fB-D \fR{/proc/bus/usb|/dev/bus/usb}/\fIBUS/DEV\fR \fB-I \fIfirmware.hex\fR [\fB-b \fIdump.bin\fR] [\fB-i\fR]

.B fpga_load -h

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fpga_load 
loads the FPGA firmware to the Xorcom Astribank device.
The syntax resembles that of fxload(8).

.SH OPTIONS
.B -b
.I dump.bin
.RS
Before writing firmware, bump the processed binary file to 
.I dump.bin\fR.
.RE

.B -D 
.I DEVICE
.RS
Required. The device to read from/write to. On modern UDEV-based system
this is usually /dev/bus/usb/\fIbus_num\fR/\fIdevice_num\fR,
where \fIbus_num\fR and \fIdevice_num\fR are the first two numbers in the
output of lsusb(8).
On older systems that use usbfs, it is usually
/proc/bus/usb/\fIbus_num\fR/\fIdevice_num\fR.
.RE

.B -r
.RS
Reset the Astribank and renumerate its USB connection to power on product ID.
.RE

.B -g
.RS
Dump all eeprom data to standard output.
.RE

.B -I
.I fireware_file
.RS
The firmware file to write to the device.
.RE

.B -i
.RS
Show information about the firmware file (valid only with \fB-I\fR option).
Example:
.PP
	./FPGA_1151.hex: Version=3297 Checksum=58270

In particular, the calculated checksum should match the output of \fIsum(1)\fR
on the binary firmware file generated by the \fB-b\fR option.
.RE

.B -v
.RS
Increase verbosity. May be used multiple times.
.RE

.B -h
.RS
Displays usage message.
.RE
